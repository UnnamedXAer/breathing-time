# Breathing Time

**Breathing Time** is a web application build in Vue as a PWA designed to help you with breathing exercises based on the Wim Hof method.
It allows you to easily adjust tempo of exercise based on your preferences. The breathing exercises are the first of the three pillars in the Wim Hof Method. You can find more information on the [Wim Hof Method official website](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/).
